You can see the result [here](https://corysia.github.io/code-small).

Each of the videos has a corresponding branch. The main branch is the latest video.

The major difference between this repo and his is that I don't use VUE. I use Typescript and Webpack due to some CSS issues I was having with VUE, specifically involving the inspector.  I'm also checking these in to GitHub as I go, so you can see the progression and a little bit of pressure to keep going.
